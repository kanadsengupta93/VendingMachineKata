This application is a simple vending machine which makes the user select a product, have them insert a coin, and have the coins return. This machine only accepts non penny coins. There is an option to turn on exact change and this machine will run out of products if too many transactions are made at the same time. I initialized the amount of items to be 5. But there is a hidden method to increase and decrease the stock.

To build and run tests on Maven please make sure you have jdk and download it as zip and run mvn -clean install on the directory.
